# Email Validator

## Overview
The Email Validator project is designed to validate email addresses and provide detailed information about them. This includes checking the format, domain, SMTP status, and more. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging an external email validation API.

## Features
- **Email:** Extracts the full email address.
- **User:** Extracts the user part of the email.
- **Domain:** Extracts the domain part of the email.
- **SMTP Check:** Indicates whether the SMTP check was successful.
- **MX Found:** Indicates whether MX records were found.
- **Role:** Identifies if the email address is a role-based address.
- **Disposable:** Checks if the email is from a disposable email provider.
- **Score:** Provides a score indicating the validity of the email.
- **State:** Provides the current state of the email validation.
- **Reason:** Provides the reason for the current state.
- **Free:** Indicates if the email is from a free email provider.
- **Format Valid:** Checks if the email format is valid.
- **Catch-all:** Indicates if the email domain has a catch-all address.

### Sample Output
